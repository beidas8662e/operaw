Example Image with a WLS Domain
===============================
This sample demonstrates how to create a WLS 12.2.1.3 domain with a Coherence cluster with WDT and run it 
inside docker containers.  The sample also includes a Coherence proxy client and proxy server program used 
to access a Coherence cache.  The image created in this sample can also be used to create a domain
using Kubernetes.  For more information on WDT, refer to https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling.  

### WDT Model File and Archive

The image created using WDT has both the WebLogic binary home and domain home.  The WDT input file, `cohDomain.yaml`, 
describes the configuration of the domain, which has WebLogic dynamic cluster with a maximum of
five managed servers.  The domain will also have a Coherence cluster scoped to the servers running in that dynamic cluster.

The sample model is accompanied by a properties files needed to create the domain. 
Care should be taken to secure the credentials that are present in the model. The ADMIN credential 
attributes in the sample model have a file token referencing a special property file. Each special 
property file must only contain a single property and can be created and modified using a text editor. 
The sample includes the files `adminuser.properties` and the `adminpass.properties` in the `properties/docker_build` directory.

The ADMIN credentials are necessary to start the Administration or Managed Server in a Docker container. 
The sample provides `security.properties` in the `properties/docker-run` directory. This file contains 
the admin credentials and additional properties used to customize the WebLogic Server start.  
It is the responsibility of the user to manage this volume, and the security.properties, in the container.

**Note**: Oracle recommends that the `adminpass.properties`, `adminuser.properties`, and `security.properties` files 
be deleted or secured after the image is built and the WebLogic Server is started so that the user name 
and password are not inadvertently exposed.

## How to Build and Run

**NOTE:** The image is based on a WebLogic Server image: `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.3`.  
Use `docker pull` to load that image into your local repository before building this sample.

The WebLogic Deploy Tool installer is required to build this image. The Docker sample requires a minimum release of 1.3.0. 
Download `weblogic-deploy.zip` to the sample directory with the following command:

    curl  -Lo ./weblogic-deploy.zip https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/download/weblogic-deploy-tooling-1.3.0/weblogic-deploy.zip
     
WDT requires the deployment artifacts to be in an archive file. This archive needs to be built (one time only) 
before building the Docker image. Build the archive.zip using the following command:

    ./build-archive.sh

The sample is using names and security credentials that are compatible with the WebLogic operator quickstart, 
see https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/.  This allows you to use this same image
to run the sample in Kubernetes.

Run the following command to build the image:

    docker build -f Dockerfile --no-cache  \
      --build-arg CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME=sample-domain1 \
      --build-arg WDT_MODEL=cohModel.yaml \
      --build-arg WDT_ARCHIVE=archive.zip \
      --build-arg WDT_VARIABLE=properties/docker-build/domain.properties  \
      --force-rm=true   \
       -t coherence-12213-domain-home-in-image-wdt .

Start the containerized Administration Server:

    docker run -d --name wlsadmin --hostname wlsadmin -p 7001:7001 -v <absolute-path-sample-dir>/properties/docker-run:/u01/oracle/properties coherence-12213-domain-home-in-image-wdt

Start a containerized Managed Server to self-register with the Administration Server.  Open the Coherence proxy port 9000 also so that the
proxy client can access the cache. Run the following command:

    docker run -d --name managed-server-1 --link wlsadmin:wlsadmin  -p 8001:8001 -p 9000:9000 -v ~/git-pfmackin-docker-images/docker-images/OracleWebLogic/samples/12213-coherence-domain-in-image-wdt/properties/docker-run:/u01/oracle/properties -e MANAGED_SERVER_NAME=managed-server-1 coherence-12213-domain-home-in-image-wdt startManagedServer.sh

To start an additional Managed Server.  There is no need to open the proxy port for this server. Run the following command:

    docker run -d --name managed-server-2 --link wlsadmin:wlsadmin -p 8002:8001 -v <absolute-path-sample-dir>/properties/docker-run:/u01/oracle/properties -e MANAGED_SERVER_NAME=managed-server-2 coherence-12213-domain-home-in-image-wdt startManagedServer.sh


Use the WebLogic console at http://localhost:7001/console to ensure that the admin server and managed servers are running.  They may take
 a few minutes to start. Once the servers are ready, you can test the Coherence cluster as follows:

Build the proxy client JAR:

    cd coh-proxy-client
    mvn package -DskipTests=true
    
Load the cache with 10,000 entries:

    java -jar target/proxy-client-1.0.jar load
 
Read each cache entry and validate the value to make sure it is correct:

     java -jar target/proxy-client-1.0.jar validate

## Summary

This sample demonstrated how to use WDT to build a WebLogic image configured with both a Coherence cluster and 
a Coherence proxy server.  We then used docker to start the admin server and two managed servers, with the first
managed server exposing port `9000` for the proxy.  Finally, the proxy client sample program was executed to load,
then validate the contents of the cache.
