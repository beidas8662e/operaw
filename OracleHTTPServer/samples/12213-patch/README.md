Applying patch on Oracle HTTP Server 
===============
This Dockerfile extends the Oracle HTTP Server image by applying a patch.

## How to Build and Run

First make sure you have built oracle/ohs:12.2.1.3.0.

Then download the patch and place it next to this README.

To build, run:
      
   $ docker build  -t oracle/ohs:12213-patch .


### Providing the Node Manager password
The user name and password must be supplied in a domain.properties file located in a HOST directory that you will map at Docker runtime with the -v option to the image directory /u01/oracle/bootdir. The properties file enables the scripts to configure the correct authentication for the Node Manager.

The format of the domain.properties file is key=value pair:
username=mynodemanagerusername
password=mynodemanagerpassword

### How to run container


If you want to start the OHS container without specifying any configuration for mod_weblogic:
1. To start the OHS container with oracle/ohs:12.2.1.3.0 image, run the following command:

         docker run -v `HOST PATH where the domain.properties file is`:/u01/oracle/bootdir -it --name ohs -p 7777:7777 oracle/ohs:12.2.1.3.0


If you want to start the OHS container with some pre-specified mod_weblogic configuration:
1. Depending on your weblogic environment , create a **custom_mod_wl_ohs.conf** file by referring to container-scripts/mod_wl_ohs.conf.sample and section 2.4 @ [OHS 12c Documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/12213/webtier/develop-plugin/oracle.htm#PLGWL553)

2. Place the custom_mod_wl_ohs.conf file in a directory in the host say,"/scratch/DockerVolume/OHSVolume" and then mount this directory into the container at the location "/config".
   By doing so, the contents of host directory /scratch/DockerVolume/OHSVolume(and hence custom_mod_wl_ohs.conf) will become available in the container at the mount point.  
   This mounting can be done by using the -v option with the 'docker run' command as shown below. The following command will start the OHS container with oracle/ohs:12.2.1.2.0-sa image and the host   directory "/scratch/DockerVolume/OHSVolume" will get mounted at the location "/config" in the container:

         $ docker run -v `HOST PATH where the domain.properties file is`:/u01/oracle/bootdir -v /scratch/DockerVolume/OHSVolume:/config -w /config -d --name ohs -p 7777:7777  oracle/ohs:12.2.1.3.0

### Stopping the  OHS instance
To stop the OHS instance, execute the following command:

      docker stop ohs (Assuming the name of conatiner is 'ohs')


To look at the Docker Container logs run:

        $ docker logs --details <Container-id>
